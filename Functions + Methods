METHODS are blocks of codes that perfom a specific TASK or FUNCTION. (perfoms the task REPEATEDLY 
without having to wrtie more code)

FUNCTIONS = 'func'

func bio(){

}

THIS IS A BLANK FUNCTION!!

a SET of BRACKETS and then a set of curly braces which CONTAINS whatever we want the function TO DO.


FUNCTION to print out a BIO of a PERSON

{

func bio(){
print("My name is \(self.name), I am \(self.age) from Wales")

}

\ and () are used to ENCASE the VARIABLE being used. ALLOWS you to add FLEXIBILITY TO YOUR FUNCTIONS 
allowing them to take ARGUMENTS or PARAMETERS and using them INSIDE your FUNC
function now ACCEPTS an argument of 'name' = when we CALL this function it's expecting a STRING to be 
passed to it which is can use. IT WILL BE CALLED NAME.

CALL a function = me.bio()

FUNTION AND METHOD ARE THE SAME THING = function becomes a method when it is CONTAINED WITHIN A CLASS
