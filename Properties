A propertie can be EITHER a VARIABLE or a CONSTANT 

variable = CHANGED 
constant = REMAINS THE SAME

VARIATION = var 
CONTANT THE SYNTAX = let 

You have to DECLARE what TYPE of the VARABLE is.
the SYNTAX for DECLARING what TYPE of VARIABLE is a :

E.E

'is of type' = :


for this example we looked at STRING + INTERGERS

STRING = Characters
INTERGER = (Whole) Numbers

{

var name: String!
var age: Int!

}

once you have DECLARED the TYPE of the PROPERTY you need to INITIALISE it. 
CREATING a NEUTRAL'title' of the VARIABLES that each object in thr class MUST have

{

init(name:String, age:Int) {
self.name = name
self.age = age
}

SELF = DIFERENTIATE between the PROPERTY 'name' and the PARAMETER 'name'

PARAMETER 'name' = in the BRACKETS after 'init'
PROPERTY = VARIABLE you set at the beginning.
