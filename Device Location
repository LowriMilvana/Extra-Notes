REQUESTING PERMISSION (YOU MUS DO THIS)

2 part process:

1. Add the relevent keys the app info.plist file
2. make the request via CLLocationManager object 

SETTING UP THE info.plist file = TWO ADDITIONS YOU NEED TO MAKE IN THIS FILE 

Privacy - Location Always and When in Use Usage Description 
Privacy - Location When in Use Usage Description 

PROVIDE AN APPROPRIATE DESCRIPTION - This is what the user sees. 

THE LOCATION MANAGER OBJECT

ANY class that wishes to use LOCATION will need to INCLUDE CoreLocation library = at the top of the file you will need to add:

{

import CoreLocation

}

// If using a MAPKIT ther is NO NEED to ass this!!

CLLocationManager = all key concepts when dealing with USER LOCATION = must be created as a PROPERTY OF THE CLASS

{

let locationManager = CLLocationManager()

}

INSIDE THE viewDidLoad method YOU WILL NEED:
LocationManager.requestAlwaysAuthorization()   -- COMPLETES THE REQUEST for the user to grant permisson to use their location
LocastionManager.delegate = self   -- 
locationManager.startUpdatingLocation()
